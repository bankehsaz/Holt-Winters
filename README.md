What is the Holt-Winters algorithm?<br/>
The Holt-Winters algorithm is a time-series forecasting method that uses exponential smoothing to make predictions based on past observations. The method considers three components of a time series: level, trend, and seasonality, and uses them to make forecasts for future periods.
